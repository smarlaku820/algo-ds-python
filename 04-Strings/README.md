## 1. Typed Out Strings (Easy)

Give two strings S and T, return if they equal when both are typed out. Any '#' that appears
in the string counts as backspace.

### Constraints to think about:-
1. What happen's if two #'s appear beside each other ?
   Delete the two values before the first #.
2. What happen's to # when there is no character to remove ?
   It deletes nothing, just like backspace would.
3. Are two empty strings are equal ?
4. Does case sensitivity matter ?


## 2. Longest Substring without repeating characters

2. Does case sensitivity matter ?
   No.


## 3. Palindromes
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring
case sensitivity.

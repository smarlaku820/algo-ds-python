# Guidelines to Problem Solving

## Step 1: Verify the constraints

Constraints are the ways we can understand the question better so that, you know what kind of edge cases
you need to consider, as well as all of the different variables that might impact how you solve the question.

This comes in the form of a dialogue, Ask your interviewer !

## Step 2: Write out some test cases

Test cases are some combinations of inputs that we could receive. Ensure that you write a Best Case Test Case where you know for sure what 
the answer will be for the given inputs that we receive.

And write down all the test cases where there are cases when no solution and what you have return in that regard.

## Step 3: Figure out a solution without code

Think of a logical solution on how you might solve this problem. If you were to approach this problem critically and logically, how would i ensure
that i have a working solution that works for all of the test cases that we just came up with.

Come up with a working solution.

## Step 4: Write out the solution in code

Figure how you can code it.

## Step 5: Write Code

## Step 6: Test your code with test cases

## Step 7: Analyze the Space and Time Complexity of your solution

When you are analyzing space and time complexity you are trying to identify the relative relationship of how much of the time and space resources your code will consume based on the size of your inputs.

## Step 8: Can we Optimize our Solution ?

When you take a look at your complexities (time and space) and learn that one of the complexity is drastically different from the other, then
there is a scope for optimization.

Example:- If you are doing multiple iterations in your code, you must look out for the possibility for combining them.
